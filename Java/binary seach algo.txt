A simple Binary Search Algorithm is as follows:

1.Calculate the mid element of the collection.
2.Compare the key items with the mid element.
3.If key = middle element, then we return the mid index position for the key found.
4.Else If key > mid element, then the key lies in the right half of the collection. Thus repeat steps 1 to 3 on the lower (right) half of the collection.
5.Else key < mid element, then the key is in the upper half of the collection. Hence you need to repeat the binary search in the upper half.
