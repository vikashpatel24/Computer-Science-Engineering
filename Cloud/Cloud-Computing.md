> Cloud computing is an internet-based computing model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, 
> on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing 
> resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can 
> be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.
